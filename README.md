# Olympics-Data-Analysis-
This project focuses on the analysis of historical Olympic medal data using Excel, Oracle SQL, and Power BI.
The objective is to uncover meaningful insights related to country performance, athlete achievements, gender participation, and sport-wise dominance through structured querying and interactive visualizations.

## Tools & Technologies
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
Oracle SQL – Data storage, querying, and analysis
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation

## Key Analysis Performed
The following analyses were performed using Oracle SQL queries and visualized in Power BI:
1.Identified the country with the highest total medal count
2.Analyzed medals won per Olympic year to study historical trends
3.Determined the top 10 athletes based on total medals won
4.Examined gender-wise medal distribution to assess participation patterns
5.Identified sports with the highest medal counts
6.Analyzed overall medal type distribution (Gold, Silver, Bronze)
7.Identified countries with the most Gold medals
8.Analyzed year-wise and country-wise medal performance
9.Identified top 5 sports by Gold medal count
10.Analyzed medal count by athlete and gender
11.Identified countries with the highest Olympic participation
12.Analyzed medal count by discipline
13.Identified athletes who won more than 5 medals
14.Determined the Olympic year with the highest number of medals
15.Analyzed medal distribution by country and medal type
16.Identified sports where medals were won by both genders

## Visualizations
Interactive dashboards were developed in Power BI using:
Bar charts
Line charts
Pie charts
These visuals effectively highlight trends, comparisons, and performance insights across different Olympic dimensions.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates the practical application of data analytics concepts, including:
Data cleaning and preparation
SQL-based data analysis
Business intelligence and visualization
